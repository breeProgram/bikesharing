# bikesharing
## Introduction
This analysis is a gathering of data into visualizations with Tableau to be used to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The data used is from CitiBike, gathered during the month of August. There is a breakdown of user information and times bikes are used throughout the month. Also, length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
This analysis shows who uses the bikes but most importantly, specific times when the bikes are being used the most or least. During some of the bikeâ€™s downtime would be the best time for repairs or cleaning bikes after heavily usage.

Another visualization I would have like to dig into would be showing the climate impact. Now a days, the importance of showing climate impact for investors is a top priority because of the public opinion on the subject. A visualization comparing the time on the bike to in a running car with co2 and the number of bikes being used in the city compared to amount of vehicles.
